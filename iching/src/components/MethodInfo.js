      <p>The yarrow-stalk method is the traditional means of calculating lines. It involves taking 50 yarrow stalks, dividing them into two random piles and calculating the remainder after dividing by four, then removing some stalks and then repeating twice more. This is done six times, for each line. The coin method involves throwing three coins, and then repeating six times, for each line. They both are random and produce equal odds of broken and unbroken lines, meaning all 64 hexagrams are equally likely, and for both methods 25% of lines will be changing. The difference is in the odds of the two types of changing lines. For the coin method, old yin (broken line changing into unbroken) and old yang (unbroken line changing into broken) are equally likely, but for the yarrow-stalk method, old yin occurs less often and old yang more often.
