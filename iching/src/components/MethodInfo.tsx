      <p>The yarrow-stalk method is the traditional means of calculating lines. It involves using 50 yarrow stalks to calculate the six lines. The three-coin method involves throwing three coins, repeating six times, for each line. They both are random and produce equal odds of broken and unbroken lines, meaning all 64 hexagrams are equally likely, and for both methods 25% of lines will be changing. The difference is in the odds of the two types of changing lines. For a more detailed explanation of how the yarrow-stalk method works and the mathematics of it, click the &#x2370;.</p>
