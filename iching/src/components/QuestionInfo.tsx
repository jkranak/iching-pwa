      <p>Asking a question is optional, but the <em>I Ching</em> is traditionally consulted with a question in mind. You should aim for a question that's neither too specific or too general. Also, questions should be more aimed at advice on what actions to take. The <em>I Ching</em> is not designed to give access to otherwise inaccessible information, such as what will happen in the future or whether a partner is secretly cheating. The <em>I Ching</em> is more a book about practical advice.</p>
